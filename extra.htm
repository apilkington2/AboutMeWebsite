			<p>I like to stay very involved in school. I've been a part of a wide variety of clubs throughout my years at Southwest. Below are some of my favoirte clubs I was in:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>debate</li>
				<li>golf</li>
				<li>student council</li>
				<li>student ambassadors</li>
				<li>young democrats</li>
				<li>NHS</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>I got to experience a lot of different things in all my clubs. I was in comptetitive things and high stress environments, as well as, environments where I met a lot of my closest friends. It helped me shape the person that I am today, and I wouldn't have trade my experiences for anything.
			
			<h2>Debate</h2>
			<p>My favorite club was probably debate. I really learned how to come out of my shell in debate. I met a lot of people from a bunch of different schools, and I was able to gain some confidence. I feel a lot more prepared for when I may have to speak in front of a large audience in the future.</p>
